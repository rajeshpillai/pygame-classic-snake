## Setup

### Create a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Follow these steps to set up the virtual environment:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```sh
   python -m venv snake_game_venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:
        - snake_game_venv\Scripts\activate

    On macOS and Linux:
        - source snake_game_venv/bin/activate

## Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Game

With the virtual environment activated and dependencies installed, you can run the Snake game:

python snake_game.py
